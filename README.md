# UtilitiesPlus Addon
UtilitiesPlus is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon that provides quick commands to execute simple tasks.

## '/way' Command
The /way command is used to create a pin at specific coordinates on the map. Here's how you can use it:
```
/way X Y
```
X and Y represent the coordinates where you want to place the pin. These values should be in the format of a numerical value representing the position on the map.

Example:
- way 36.6 71.6 - Creates a pin at coordinates (36.6, 71.6) on the map.
- way clear - Clears the current pin.


## '/clearbars' Command
The /clearbars command is used to remove all abilities and items from your action bars. Here's how you can use it:
```
/clearbars
```
